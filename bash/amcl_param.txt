~min_particles (int, default: 100) 
Minimum allowed number of particles. 
~max_particles (int, default: 5000) 
Maximum allowed number of particles. 
~kld_err (double, default: 0.01) 
Maximum error between the true distribution and the estimated distribution. 
~kld_z (double, default: 0.99) 
Upper standard normal quantile for (1 - p), where p is the probability that the error on the estimated distrubition will be less than kld_err. 
~update_min_d (double, default: 0.2 meters) 
Translational movement required before performing a filter update. 
~update_min_a (double, default: π/6.0 radians) 
Rotational movement required before performing a filter update. 
~resample_interval (int, default: 2) 
Number of filter updates required before resampling. 
~transform_tolerance (double, default: 0.1 seconds) 
Time with which to post-date the transform that is published, to indicate that this transform is valid into the future. 
~recovery_alpha_slow (double, default: 0.0 (disabled)) 
Exponential decay rate for the slow average weight filter, used in deciding when to recover by adding random poses. A good value might be 0.001. 
~recovery_alpha_fast (double, default: 0.0 (disabled)) 
Exponential decay rate for the fast average weight filter, used in deciding when to recover by adding random poses. A good value might be 0.1. 
~initial_pose_x (double, default: 0.0 meters) 
Initial pose mean (x), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. 
~initial_pose_y (double, default: 0.0 meters) 
Initial pose mean (y), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. 
~initial_pose_a (double, default: 0.0 radians) 
Initial pose mean (yaw), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. 
~initial_cov_xx (double, default: 0.5*0.5 meters) 
Initial pose covariance (x*x), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. 
~initial_cov_yy (double, default: 0.5*0.5 meters) 
Initial pose covariance (y*y), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. 
~initial_cov_aa (double, default: (π/12)*(π/12) radian) 
Initial pose covariance (yaw*yaw), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. 
~gui_publish_rate (double, default: -1.0 Hz) 
Maximum rate (Hz) at which scans and paths are published for visualization, -1.0 to disable. 
~save_pose_rate (double, default: 0.5 Hz) 
Maximum rate (Hz) at which to store the last estimated pose and covariance to the parameter server, in the variables ~initial_pose_* and ~initial_cov_*. This saved pose will be used on subsequent runs to initialize the filter. -1.0 to disable. 
~use_map_topic (bool, default: false) 
When set to true, AMCL will subscribe to the map topic rather than making a service call to receive its map. New in navigation 1.4.2
~first_map_only (bool, default: false) 
When set to true, AMCL will only use the first map it subscribes to, rather than updating each time a new one is received. New in navigation 1.4.2
